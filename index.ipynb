    "\n",
    "Welcome to Python exercises! In this self-guided course, you will learn the basics of Python, which is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages. It is used extensively in computational and data science, and we will use it in almost all our modules. Therefore, it is important for you to familiarise yourself with Python syntax before you begin your course.\n",

After the installation is complete, in Terminal (Linux and MacOS) or in Anaconda Prompt (Windows), navigate to the Python exercises directory, create a new conda environment, and activate it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "$ conda activate intro-to-python\n",
    "``` \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Open Jupyter Notebook**. In the environment you just activated, run:\n",
